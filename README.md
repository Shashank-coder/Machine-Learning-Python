# Machine-Learning-Python

Applying ML algorithms in python using libraries numpy, scipy, matplotlib on Anaconda platform.

Also applying the algorithms by coding ourselves and testing its accuracy.

Using built-in algorithms of sci-kit learn on datasets from quandl etc. and playing with the data to predict useful information out of it.
